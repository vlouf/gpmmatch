# üõ∞Ô∏è gpmmatch üõ∞Ô∏è

gpmmatch is a Python library for matching satellite and ground-based radar volumes. It is primarily designed for use with GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) data, but also supports the latest TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) products.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Branch and Radar Format Compatibility

> **Important Notice on Branch Usage and Radar Format Support**

The `master` branch of this repository uses **`pyodim`** for radar data I/O and is **only compatible with ODIM HDF5 radar format**. This branch is used in **operational environments**, and **ODIM is the only officially supported radar format** for production use.

If you are working with other radar formats (e.g., NEXRAD, UF, SIGMET, etc.), please use the `pyart` branch, which integrates with the **Py-ART** library and supports a wider range of radar data formats.

| Branch   | Radar I/O Library | Supported Formats         | Intended Use            |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| `master` | `pyodim`          | ODIM only                 | Operational (official)   |
| `pyart`  | `Py-ART`          | Multiple radar formats    | Research & development   |

Please ensure you are using the appropriate branch and radar I/O backend for your application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Libraries Needed

The following Python libraries are required to use `gpmmatch` (master branch with `pyodim` support, `pyart` branch with `pyart` support):

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `netCDF4`
- `xarray`
- `dask`
- `pyodim`

You can install the core dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas netCDF4 xarray dask
```

## Example Jupyter Notebook

An example Jupyter notebook is available in the `example` directory. This notebook demonstrates how to use the `gpmmatch` library to a volume matching of GPM data against radar data. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for downloading a sample of radar data from the Australian weather radar network archive. Finally, the notebook uses Matplotlib to create a plot of the results of the GPMmatch technique.
