# üõ∞Ô∏è gpmmatch üõ∞Ô∏è

`gpmmatch` is a Python library for ground-radar vs satellite volume-matching. It is built to work with GPM, but also supports the latest version of TRMM products.

## Libraries needed:

- arm_pyart
- numpy
- pandas 
- netCDF4
- xarray
- dask
- pyodim

These libraries can be installed using pip:
```
pip install numpy pandas netCDF4 xarray dask arm_pyart
```

In addition, you will need to install the `gpmmatch` and `pyodim` libraries from Github:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/vlouf/gpmmatch.git
pip install git+https://github.com/vlouf/pyodim.git`
```

## Example Jupyter Notebook

An example Jupyter notebook is available in the `example` directory. This notebook demonstrates how to use the `gpmmatch` library to a volume matching of GPM data against radar data. The notebook provides step-by-step instructions for downloading a sample of radar data from the Australian weather radar network archive. Finally, the notebook uses Matplotlib to create a plot of the results of the GPMmatch technique.
